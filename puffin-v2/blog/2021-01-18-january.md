### Account Approval
As a marketplace operators, you will be able to do a KYC process before approving stores to be shown in the marketplace. A bigger marketplace wants to regulate everything happening in it's business

- Marketplace owner able to approve a store in superadmin panel similar to our existing listing approval

- Until the store is activated, a seller account will not be visible in the marketplace from feed to search
- A seller will have a label in his shop to see the account approval status

Coming soon:
- Sellers receive a push notification notification when his store is approved or disapproved


### Attribute Enhancement
Every new attribute type is an opportunity for marketplace to increase user experience

- Now you can get file attachment on account level or listing level. This will help you to do activities from KYC process to simple file verification 
- You can make attribute as private or public. Use cases like private data you want to gather from accounts/storeowners
