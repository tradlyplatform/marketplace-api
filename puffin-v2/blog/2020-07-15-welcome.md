We are pleased to announce our Tradly Platform knowledge portal which includes everything from documentation to detailed recipes on how to build a platform business. 

We are starting small with information what we believe is needed for customers to start ahead. However, we will be regularly every week updating the contents to reflect new product updates and contents for our customers to be updated on what we are upto. 

WE are 100% sure this knowledge portal may not be perfect thing but we want to start small and continue build things on top of it. 

Primary objectives of this platform 
- Providing detailed documentation on features provided by Tradly Platform
- Step by step information on building different platform business model - Targeting one modal explanation every 10days
- Not as Primary source of API-Reference but as a secondary reference
- Superadmin Panel - How to guides 
- Marketplace extentions - Integrations guides 
- FAQ, Other doubts. 

Keep your ideas coming if there is anything missing on this portal
