### Do you have web app?
Currently we don't have full fledged web app. And we are not planning to prioritise this anytime soon to provide a offering. However we are working on to make our web app a open source solution for community developers to spin off and customise according to their needs. 

Two approaches using our Headless API product
1. Opensourcing our webapp which will be free of cost. Hence your web development agencies can take the skeleton and build up on it. 2020Q1 or 2021Q2 (Previously it was planned for Q1 but due to refocus on SuperAdmin, we are delaying this)
2.  Working with trategic partners who can develop the web app from scratch using Tradly API or still forking the existing repository to develop further. 

### How much does it cost to develop webapp?


1. Website development - Depends on the UI requirements (Range from 4K to 10K USD) if you use our partners to develop
    1. or you can use your own developers with your own design and consume our API. Our API is just 0.49% of the total marketplace transaction as shared before.
    2. our partners will take 30-50 working days to complete this. 
    3. Pros: You will own the website code
### Can we get additional functionalities?
Yes you can request functionalities. We approach this additional requirements in few ways
For example: 
* A client who recently signed up with us wanted an account approval process and file attachment (We had this already in our roadmap but we prioritised as paying clients need it) > We launched his mvp but added this account approval subsequently
* Same goes to another client. We didn't support store level reviews before, we have it now activated for them within a month. 
* Another client who is asking about custom subscription based revenue model. We are now working on it as she is a serious subscribed customer. 
  
So to answer your above questions. It depends on how serious are you about us and timeline on this. 

### What I will get in my first build?
You will get the whitelabel version of your app with all the existing functionality tested and working. This is the 10days commitment we make provided that you finish 3rd party tools signup(2hours) and appstore/playstore licences. 

All your enhancements will be provided in the next build. If you really want to have your enhancement be available in the first build itself, then we might take time within a month and provide the build. New feature enhancements will take analysis, communication, testing in different environment and launch.
