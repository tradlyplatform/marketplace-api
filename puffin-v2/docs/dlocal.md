## How Dlocal works 

Assuming a marketplace named 23mercado
- When a seller opens the account with 23mercado, 23mercado need to collect any information that dlocal need to do the KYC process for sending funds to them
- When a colombia buyer pays the money in local currency to 23mercado for any sales, the money flows to 23mercado's dlocal account
- dlocal deducts their payment fee (averagely 4%- #%) based on country and payment method
- 23mercado employees need to deduct the commission (example:5%) manually
- 23mercado employees need to add seller bank details for the payout
- TradlyPlatform team would have integrated the dlocal API to send this bulk information from 23mercado to Dlocal
- Dlocal team will process the payout of the sellers in colombia
